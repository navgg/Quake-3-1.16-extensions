=============================================================================

cg_delag 1|0 - If this is set to "1" (the default), your lag with all 
  instant-hit weapons will be compensated for. You can also set it for 
  individual weapons. These are the important values:

    1 - Everything
    2 - Shotgun
    4 - Machinegun
    8 - Lightning Gun
    16 - Railgun

  Add the values together. For example, if you want lag compensation for 
  just the lightning gun and the machinegun, you would set cg_delag to "12".

cg_delag_projectileNudge 0..999 - projectile time nudge, set it to your 
  average ping on server may make easier dodging rockets

cg_delag_optimizePrediction 1|0 - optimized prediction, if your CPU 
  bottleneck this may give some serious perfomance improvement

cg_delag_cmdTimeNudge 0..999 - number of milliseconds you would like the 
  server to "nudge" the time of your instant-hit attacks. For example, if 
  you feel that the server overcompensates for your ping, you might try 
  setting it to 25. That will effectively add 25ms of lag.
